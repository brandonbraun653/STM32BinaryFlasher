# STM32BinaryFlasher
A simple wrapper around the texane [open-source stlink utilities](https://github.com/texane/stlink), intended for use with my automated
testbench on various embedded projects utilizing the STM32 chips. Any features I have are simply because I used them, so if you want
something added, feel free to submit a pull request.
